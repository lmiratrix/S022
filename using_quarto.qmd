# Creating Reports in Quarto

## What is Quarto?

Quarto is the "next-generation" of RMarkdown. Most tutorials on Quarto are intended for people who have experience with RMarkdown, so a great place to start is to watch Luke's video on RMarkdown. You can find it on [this page](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/118862/pages/week-1-intro-to-r), under the "Do it for Lab" tab.

Once you're familiar with RMarkdown, the tricks you know will almost always work in Quarto. The major difference is that Quarto will render *inside* RStudio, as you write your document, which makes it a little nicer to work with. There are other new (and very cool) features, but they aren't essential for anything in this course.

## Using Visual Editor with Rmd

An obvious, cool thing about Quarto is the fancy visual editor, but you can turn this feature on for regular old RMarkdown files, too. Just click on this ![](image/paste-30ECD09B.png), and click "use visual editor." You can also add `editor: visual` to the yaml (top-matter) of an rmd file and it'll open in the visual editor by default.

## Creating a Quarto Report

In RStudio, click this icon in the upper left: ![](image/paste-957CADD7.png)

That'll give you the following drop-down menu, where you can select "Quarto Document":

When you click on "Quarto Document..." RStudio might take a few seconds to load. Then you'll see this pop-up:\

Fill out the document title and author (just like for RMarkdown). You can always change the title and author later. You'll want to render your reports as PDFs, so select that option. Finally, hit the "Create" button at the bottom.

RStudio will load up a new Quarto doc (with some boilerplate markdown in it). From here, you can treat it like an RMarkdown file.

## Rendering to PDF

To render your report to PDF, you'll need to have an installation of LaTex. You can set this up from within RStudio.

Down by your console, there's a tab called "Terminal." Click on it to open the terminal. Inside the terminal type the following:\
`quarto install tool tinytex`

I recommend restarting your computer after this.

Now you should be able to click ![](image/paste-5DE6FBD9.png) and get a pdf version of your report. By default, a copy of the pdf will be saved in the same folder as your Quarto document.

## A Couple Quick Tricks

#### Making Code Chunks

Use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+alt+i` or `command + option + i` to create a new R code chunk.

#### Adding Images

You can copy-paste or drag-and-drop images into a Quarto doc. That's how I put the above screenshots into this document.

## Additional Quarto Resources

Here are a couple more links if you'd like to learn more:

-   Grab the [RMarkdown Cheatsheet](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/?type=posit-cheatsheets&_page=2/) (lots of other great cheatsheets there, too). Most things that work in RMarkdown work in Quarto.

-   [Quarto Intro Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VcxMOnj3M) This video walks through using Quarto for the first time.
