# Getting Started with R {.unnumbered}

To get started with R, first download and install R and RStudio (the IDE, or integrated development environment, that makes using R much, much more pleasant).Â  See links at [this HGSE software support page.](https://its.gse.harvard.edu/research-software-support)

## Some Resources and Directions

The following are ways of getting help with R.

### Handouts {.unnumbered}

This textbook has many handouts written by the teaching team that illustrates how to use R for a variety of tasks. Also see the Resources page on Canvas for further commentary and organization.

### Class Code {.unnumbered}

Each class has a R script that shows how to do the stuff from that class. See the Packets on Canvas for this code.

### A Very Important Online Textbook {.unnumbered}

The online textbook [R for Data Science.](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) provides important information on wrangling data, making plots, and doing statistical programming. It is full of examples and code snippets you can steal. There are two versions:

 * [The First Edition](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) -- this what we often refer to in these materials.  But we are slowly updating to...
 * [The Second Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) -- this one has a different organization, less weird modeling, and covers recent changes to the "tidyverse."
 
 
### Class Sections {.unnumbered}

Sections will typically have a hands-on component which will give you a chance to try things out yourself. These sections will also publish the final R code for future reference. See the section pages on Canvas to get this information.

### Office Hours {.unnumbered}

Office hours are fine time to get help troubleshooting a specific or script you are working on.

### GSE Stat Help Desk {.unnumbered}

Education students can write to [stathelp\@gse.harvard.edu](mailto:stathelp@gse.harvard.edu) to get help getting started with R. If groups of 3 or more want some tutorials, they can ask for them as well.

The Help Desk sometimes has Intro to R workshops. For example, grab some old workshop materials here: <http://its.gse.harvard.edu/gentle-introduction-r>
