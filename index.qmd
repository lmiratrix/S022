# Preface {.unnumbered}

This "book" is basically a set of handouts generated for a Data Science in Education course taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Education by Luke Miratrix. They are loosely organized, but the primary purpose is to make all the handouts easy to access and find.

The handouts were generated in response to student questions, and aim to short-circuit staring at the possibly confusing world of Stack Overflow. They are curated in the sense that these activities tend to come up over and over in the course of fundamental data science work.

I hope you find this resource useful. Please send feedback to `lmiratrix@g.harvard.edu`.

## A note on duplicated material

Some of this material is taken from a sister "textbook" for my MLM course (S043/Stat151). That textbook is [here](https://lmiratrix.github.io/MLM/). In particular, you will find entire chapters of that textbook replicated here.
