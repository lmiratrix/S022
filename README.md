# S022 Handout Textbook

Collection of handouts for S022--Data Science in Education. This is a repo for a Quarto Bookdown textbook.

## Installing this textbook

You can browse online, but if you want all the code, etc., you can check out the GitHub repo and then build the book on your local machine.

To install libraries, try sourcing the `package_lister.R` file:

```         
source( "package_lister.R" )
```

This attempts to detect all used packages and then install all of them. Possibly buggy and incomplete.
